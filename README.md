# vNES

A mirror of Jamie Sanders' Java NES emulator.

It has now disappeared from its original location, virtualnes.com, but I have pieced this together from files on my hard disk and from the web. 

If you're looking for the actual README, [version 2.13 has one](https://github.com/bfirsh/vNES/blob/2.13/README).

[JSNES](https://github.com/bfirsh/jsnes) is based on this emulator.
